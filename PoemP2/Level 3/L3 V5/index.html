  An artist has a busy mind.<br>
  Whether it be lines of a poem<br>
  or lines of a play.<br>
  One may argue that literature cannot be art,<br>
  But I will look at the accuser and ask him to count the callouses on my hands<br>
  he’ll ask what for,<br>
  what they are from,<br>
  and as I count them I’ll tell him,<br>
  "From crawling out of my own little hell."<br>
  Of course, he’ll scoff and leave, but who is he to blame?<br>
  Poets are emotional.<br>
  Others fear to feel.<br>
  Which, in retrospect, is very ironic when you think about it, because technically, they are still feeling.<br>
  <br>
  <b>My mind is like rush hour all hours of the day,</b><br>
  Because there is so much left to think about,<br>
  So little time to enact,<br>
  So little time to involve yourself in the thoughts.<br>
  Things occupy my mind often and when I sit alone on a park bench,<br>
  I see a collection of cars screeching against the pavement toward me,<br>
  or hear a phone call that tells me my mother,<br>
  my father,<br>
  my sister,<br>
  my brother,<br>
  is or are dead when all of the above are very much alive.<br>
  <br>
  No, my mind does not silence,<br>
  It is persuasive and deceiving and it never fails to fail me,<br>
  Yet I’m trapped inside, because it’s all I've got.<br>
  When people ask if I’m alright, I respond with<br>
  "I’m fine! I’m perfectly OK!"<br>
  Because this is how my mind has been since I could count to ten,<br>
  and I cannot seem to picture it being any other way.<br>
  <br>
  Normality is boring, but normality is accepted.<br>
  <b>Being expressive is not.</b><br>
  So I’m told I’m too emotional when I speak in a crowded room,<br>
  I do not argue, though I still wonder how<br>
  An obnoxious burst of laughter is far too expressive.<br>
  They say the saddest people laugh the loudest<br>
  Because they are most vulnerable and susceptible to a comedian’s antics,<br>
  Especially considering they've muted their own expression to the point of near insanity,<br>
  Smiling and suicidal,<br>
  Laughing but decaying and cracking drastically with each and every chuckle,<br>
  Ironic like an abandoned amusement park-<br>
  A dying happy place.<br>
  People say that “the saddest people have the brightest eyes,”<br>
  And the most common compliment I get is<br>
  “*******- I love your eyes!”<br>
  <br>
  I do not try to be obnoxious.<br>
  The words slip, and the volume cracks up,<br>
  And my mind continues running when I am standing still.<br>
  I am trying to figure out why I cannot catch my breath,<br>
  When I am not even moving.<br>
  <br>
  I wish I could be normal,<br>
  I wish I wasn't so ****** up and broken<br>
  But you can’t just take a totaled car,<br>
  hand someone the keys and say,<br>
  "Take her for a spin!"<br>
  Because it will forever feel useless and it will not function.<br>
  Therefore, neither will I.<br>
  <br>
  Writing helps in easing the plethora of trains speeding through my mind,<br>
  Trains of thought just chugging along,<br>
  But it only slows them down, if only for a while.<br>
  <br>
  As an inexperienced conductor,<br>
  When someone asks me if I’m “BUSY,”<br>
  I can never answer them “no” honestly,<br>
  <br>
