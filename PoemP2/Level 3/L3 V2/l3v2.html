            <p>An artist has a busy mind.<br>
Whether it be lines of a poem<br>
or lines of a play.<br>
One may argue that literature cannot be art,<br>
But I will look at the accuser and ask him to count the callouses on my hands<br>
he’ll ask what for,<br>
what they are from,<br>
and as I count them I’ll tell him,<br>
"From crawling out of my own little hell."<br>
Of course, he’ll scoff and leave, but who is he to blame?<br>
Poets are emotional.<br>
Others fear to feel.<br>
Which, in retrospect, is very ironic when you think about it, because technically, <b><i>they are still feeling.</i></b></p>

              <p>My mind is like rush hour all hours of the day,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Because there is so much left to think about,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
So little time to enact,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
So little time to involve yourself in the thoughts.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Things occupy my mind often and when I sit alone on a park bench,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I see a collection of cars screeching against the pavement toward me,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
or hear a phone call that tells me my mother,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
my father,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
my sister,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
my brother,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
is or are dead when all of the above are very much alive.</p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

                No,<small>my mind does not silence,</small> <br>
It is persuasive and deceiving and it never fails to fail me,<br>
Yet I’m trapped inside, because it’s all I've got.<br>
When people ask if I’m alright, I respond with<br>
<b>"I’m fine! I’m perfectly OK!"</b><br>
Because this is how my mind has been since I could count to ten,<br>
and I cannot seem to picture it being any other way.<br>

<p>Normality is boring, but normality is accepted.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Being expressive is not.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
So I’m told I’m too emotional when I speak in a crowded room,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I do not argue, though I still wonder how&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
An obnoxious burst of laughter is far too expressive.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
They say the saddest people laugh the loudest&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Because they are most vulnerable and susceptible to a comedian’s antics,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Especially considering they've muted their own expression to the point of near insanity,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Smiling and suicidal,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Laughing but decaying and cracking drastically with each and every chuckle,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Ironic like an abandoned amusement park-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
A dying happy place.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
People say that “the saddest people have the brightest eyes,”&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
And the most common compliment I get is&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
“*******- I love your eyes!”</p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

<small>I do not try to be obnoxious.</small><br>
The words slip, and the volume cracks up,<br>

hand someone the keys and say,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
"Take her for a spin!"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Because it will forever feel useless and it will not function.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Writing helps in easing the plethora of trains speeding through my mind,
Trains of thought just chugging along,
But it only slows them down, if only for a while.
<br>
As an inexperienced conductor,
When someone asks me if I’m “BUSY,”
I can never answer them “no” honestly,
