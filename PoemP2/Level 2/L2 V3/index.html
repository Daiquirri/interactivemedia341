An artist has a busy mind. <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>
Whether it be lines of a poem <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
or lines of a play. <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>
One may argue that literature cannot be art, <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
But I will look at the accuser and ask him to count the callouses on my hands <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>
he’ll ask what for, <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
what they are from, <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>
and as I count them I’ll tell him, <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
"From crawling out of my own little hell." <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>
Of course, he’ll scoff and leave, but who is he to blame? <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
Poets are emotional. <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>
Others fear to feel. <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
Which, in retrospect, is very ironic when you think about it, because technically, they are still feeling. <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>

My mind is like rush hour all hours of the day, <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
Because there is so much left to think about, <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>
So little time to enact, <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
So little time to involve yourself in the thoughts. <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>
Things occupy my mind often and when I sit alone on a park bench, <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
I see a collection of cars screeching against the pavement toward me, <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>
or hear a phone call that tells me my mother, <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
my father, <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>
my sister, <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
my brother, <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>
is or are dead when all of the above are very much alive. <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>

No, my mind does not silence, <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>
It is persuasive and deceiving and it never fails to fail me, <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
Yet I’m trapped inside, because it’s all I've got. <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>
When people ask if I’m alright, I respond with <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
"I’m fine! I’m perfectly OK!" <tt><small><b>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </b></small></tt><br>
Because this is how my mind has been since I could count to ten, <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
and I cannot seem to picture it being any other way. <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>

Normality is boring, but normality is accepted. <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
Being expressive is not. <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>
So I’m told I’m too emotional when I speak in a crowded room, <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
I do not argue, though I still wonder how <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>
An obnoxious burst of laughter is far too expressive. <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
They say the saddest people laugh the loudest <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>
Because they are most vulnerable and susceptible to a comedian’s antics, <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
Especially considering they've muted their own expression to the point of near insanity, <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>
Smiling and suicidal, <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
Laughing but decaying and cracking drastically with each and every chuckle, <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>
Ironic like an abandoned amusement park- <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
A dying happy place. <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>
People say that “the saddest people have the brightest eyes,” <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
And the most common compliment I get is <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>
“*******- I love your eyes!” <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>

I do not try to be obnoxious. <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>
The words slip, and the volume cracks up, <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
And my mind continues running when I am standing still. <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>
I am trying to figure out why I cannot catch my breath, <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
When I am not even moving.<tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>

I wish I could be normal, <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
I wish I wasn't so ****** up and broken <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>
But you can’t just take a totaled car, <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
hand someone the keys and say, <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>
"Take her for a spin!" <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
Because it will forever feel useless and it will not function. <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>
Therefore, neither will I. <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>

Writing helps in easing the plethora of trains speeding through my mind, <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>
Trains of thought just chugging along, <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
But it only slows them down, if only for a while. <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>

As an inexperienced conductor, <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>
When someone asks me if I’m “BUSY,” <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br>
I can never answer them “no” honestly, <tt><small><i>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </i></small></tt><br>

Because an artist has a busy mind. <tt><small>busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busybusy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busybusy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy </small></tt><br><br>
