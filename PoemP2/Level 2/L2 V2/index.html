      <h6><small>An artist has a busy mind.<br>
Whether it be lines of a poem<br>
or lines of a play.<br>
One may argue that literature cannot be art,<br>
But I will look at the accuser and ask him to count the callouses on my hands<br>
he’ll ask what for,<br>
what they are from,<br>
and as I count them I’ll tell him,<br>
"From crawling out of my own little hell."<br>
Of course, he’ll scoff and leave, but who is he to blame?<br>
Poets are emotional.<br>
Others fear to feel.<br>
Which, in retrospect, is very ironic when you think about it, because technically, they are still feeling.</h6></small><br>
<br>
<h6>My mind is like rush hour all hours of the day,<br>
Because there is so much left to think about,<br>
So little time to enact,<br>
So little time to involve yourself in the thoughts.<br>
Things occupy my mind often and when I sit alone on a park bench,<br>
I see a collection of cars screeching against the pavement toward me,<br>
or hear a phone call that tells me my mother,
my father,<br>
my sister,<br>
my brother,<br>
is or are dead when all of the above are very much alive.</h6><br>
<br>
<h5><small>No, my mind does not silence,<br>
It is persuasive and deceiving and it never fails to fail me,<br>
Yet I’m trapped inside, because it’s all I've got.<br>
When people ask if I’m alright, I respond with<br>
<i>"I’m fine! I’m perfectly OK!"</i><br>
Because this is how my mind has been since I could count to ten,<br>
and I cannot seem to picture it being any other way.</small><br></h5>
<br>
<h5>Normality is boring, but normality is accepted.<br>
Being expressive is not.<br>
So I’m told I’m too emotional when I speak in a crowded room,<br>
I do not argue, though I still wonder how<br>
An obnoxious burst of laughter is far too expressive.<br>
They say the saddest people laugh the loudest<br>
Because they are most vulnerable and susceptible to a comedian’s antics,<br>
Especially considering they've muted their own expression to the point of near insanity,<br>
Smiling and suicidal,<br>
Laughing but decaying and cracking drastically with each and every chuckle,<br>
Ironic like an abandoned amusement park-<br>
A dying happy place.<br>
People say that “the saddest people have the brightest eyes,”<br>
And the most common compliment I get is<br>
“*******- I love your eyes!”</h5><br>
<br>
<h4><small>I do not try to be obnoxious.<br>
The words slip, and the volume cracks up,<br>
And my mind continues running when I am standing still.<br>
I am trying to figure out why I cannot catch my breath,<br>
When I am not even moving.</small></h4><br>
<br>
<h4>I wish I could be normal,<br>
I wish I wasn't so ****** up and broken<br>
But you can’t just take a totaled car,<br>
hand someone the keys and say,<br>
"Take her for a spin!"<br>
Because it will forever feel useless and it will not function.<br>
Therefore, neither will I.<br></h4>
<br>
<h3>Writing helps in easing the plethora of trains speeding through my mind,<br>
Trains of thought just chugging along,<br>
But it only slows them down, if only for a while.</h3><br>
<br>
<h2>As an inexperienced conductor,<br>
When someone asks me if I’m “BUSY,”<br>
I can never answer them “no” honestly,</h2><br>
<br>
