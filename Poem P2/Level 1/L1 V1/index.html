		<p>An artist has a <mark>busy</mark> mind.
		Whether it be lines of a poem
		or lines of a play.
		One may argue that literature cannot be art,
		But I will look at the accuser and ask him to count the callouses on my hands
		he’ll ask what for,
		what they are from,
		and as I count them I’ll tell him,
		"From crawling out of my own little <mark>hell."</mark>
		Of course, he’ll scoff and leave, but who is he to blame?
		Poets are emotional.
		<mart>Others fear to feel.</mart>
		Which, in retrospect, is very ironic when you think about it, because technically, they are still feeling.
		
		My mind is like <mark>rush hour</mark> all hours of the day,
		Because there is so much left to think about,
		So little time to enact,
		So little time to involve yourself in the thoughts.
		Things <mark>occupy</mark> my mind often and when I sit alone on a park bench,
		I see a collection of cars screeching against the pavement toward me,
		or hear a phone call that tells me my mother,
		my father,
		my sister,
		my brother,
		is or are <mark>dead</mark> when all of the above are very much alive.
		
		No, my mind does not silence,
		It is persuasive and deceiving and it never fails to fail me,
		Yet I’m <mark>trapped inside,</mark> because it’s all I've got.
		When people ask if I’m alright, I respond with
		<mark>"I’m fine! I’m perfectly OK!"</mark>
		Because this is how my mind has been since I could count to ten,
		and I cannot seem to picture it being any other way.
		
		Normality is boring, but normality is accepted.
		Being <mark>expressive</mark> is not.
		So I’m told I’m too <mark>emotional</mark> when I speak in a crowded room,
		I do not argue, though I still wonder how
		An <mark>obnoxious burst</mark> of laughter is far too expressive.
		They say the saddest people laugh the loudest
		Because they are most vulnerable and susceptible to a comedian’s antics,
		Especially considering they've muted their own expression to the point of near insanity,
		<mark>Smiling</mark> and suicidal,
		Laughing but <mark>decaying</mark> and cracking drastically with each and every chuckle,
		Ironic like an <mark>abandoned</mark> amusement park-
		A dying happy place.
		People say that “the saddest people have the brightest eyes,”
		And the most common compliment I get is
		“*******- I love your eyes!”
		
		I do not try to be obnoxious.
		The words slip, and the volume cracks up,
		And my mind <mark>continues running</mark> when I am <mark>standing still.</mark>
		I am trying to figure out why I cannot catch my breath,
		When I am not even <mark>moving</mark>
		
		I <mark>wish</mark> I could be normal,
		<mark>I wish I wasn't so ****** up and broken</mark>
		But you can’t just take a totaled car,
		hand someone the keys and say,
		"Take her for a spin!"
		Because it will forever feel useless and it will not <mark>function.</mark>
		Therefore, neither will I.
		
		Writing helps in easing the <mark>plethora</mark> of trains <mark>speeding</mark> through my <mark>mind,</mark>
		Trains of thought just chugging along,
		But it only slows them down, if only for a while.
		
		As an <mark>inexperienced</mark> conductor,
		When someone asks me if I’m <mark>“BUSY,”</mark>
		I can never answer them “no” honestly,
		
		Because an artist has a <mark>busy</mark> mind.
