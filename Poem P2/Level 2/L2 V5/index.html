<h6>An artist has a busy mind.</h6> <br>
<h5>Whether it be lines of a poem</h5><br>
<h4>or lines of a play</h4>.<br>
<h3>One may argue that literature cannot be art,</h3><br>
<h2>But I will look at the accuser and ask him to count the callouses on my hands</h2><br>
<h1>he’ll ask what for,</h1><br>
<h2>what they are from,</h2><br>
<h3>and as I count them I’ll tell him,</h3><br>
<h4>"From crawling out of my own little hell."</h4><br>
<h5>Of course, he’ll scoff and leave, but who is he to blame?</h5><br>
<h6>Poets are emotional.</h6><br>
<h5>Others fear to feel.</h5><br>
<h4>Which, in retrospect, is very ironic when you think about it, because technically, they are still feeling.</h4><br>

<h3>My mind is like rush hour all hours of the day,></h3><br>
<h2>Because there is so much left to think about,</h2><br>
<h1>So little time to enact,</h1><br>
<h2>So little time to involve yourself in the thoughts.</h2><br>
<h3>Things occupy my mind often and when I sit alone on a park bench,</h3><br>
<h4>I see a collection of cars screeching against the pavement toward me,</h4><br>
<h5>or hear a phone call that tells me my mother,</h5><br>
<h6>my father,</h6><br>
<h5>my sister,</h5><br>
<h4>my brother,</h4><br>
<h3>is or are dead when all of the above are very much alive.</h3><br>

<h2>No, my mind does not silence,</h2><br>
<h1>It is persuasive and deceiving and it never fails to fail me,</h1><br>
<h2>Yet I’m trapped inside, because it’s all I've got.</h2><br>
<h3>When people ask if I’m alright, I respond with</h3><br>
<h4>"I’m fine! I’m perfectly OK!"</h4><br>
<h5>Because this is how my mind has been since I could count to ten,</h5><br>
<h6>and I cannot seem to picture it being any other way.</h6><br>

<h5>Normality is boring, but normality is accepted.</h5><br>
<h4>Being expressive is not.</h4><br>
<h3>So I’m told I’m too emotional when I speak in a crowded room,</h3><br>
<h2>I do not argue, though I still wonder how</h2><br>
<h1>An obnoxious burst of laughter is far too expressive.</h1><br>
<h2>They say the saddest people laugh the loudest</h2><br>
<h3>Because they are most vulnerable and susceptible to a comedian’s antics,</h3><br>
<h4>Especially considering they've muted their own expression to the point of near insanity,</h4><br>
<h5>Smiling and suicidal,</h5><br>
<h6>Laughing but decaying and cracking drastically with each and every chuckle,</h6><br>
<h5>Ironic like an abandoned amusement park-<</h5>br>
<h4>A dying happy place.</h4><br>
<h3>People say that “the saddest people have the brightest eyes,”</h3><br>
<h2>And the most common compliment I get is</h2><br>
<h1>“*******- I love your eyes!”</h1><br>

I do not try to be obnoxious.<br>
The words slip, and the volume cracks up,<br>
And my mind continues running when I am standing still.<br>
I am trying to figure out why I cannot catch my breath,<br>
When I am not even moving.<br>

I wish I could be normal,<br>
I wish I wasn't so ****** up and broken<br>
But you can’t just take a totaled car,<br>
hand someone the keys and say,<br>
"Take her for a spin!"<br>
Because it will forever feel useless and it will not function.<br>
Therefore, neither will I.<br>

Writing helps in easing the plethora of trains speeding through my mind,<br>
Trains of thought just chugging along,<br>
But it only slows them down, if only for a while.<br>

As an inexperienced conductor,<br>
When someone asks me if I’m “BUSY,”<br>
I can never answer them “no” honestly,<br>

Because an artist has a busy mind.<br>
